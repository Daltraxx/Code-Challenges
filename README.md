# Coding Algorithm Challenges

This repository contains solutions to various coding algorithm and data structure challenges I have completed, primarily from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and a smaller subset from [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/). Solutions are primarily written in Javascript and/or Java. There are nearly 400 personally worked-out solutions within and counting, as I try to complete at least one challenge a day.

## Structure

- The repository is generally organized into folders with names refering to the dominant algorithmic pattern or data structure used to solve the challenges within them.

## Topics Covered

- Manipulation of Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Tree and Graph Traversal
- Greedy Approaches
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Heaps
- Prefix Sum
- Binary Search
- Stacks & Queues
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointer
- Monotonic
- And more...

## How to Use

Browse the repository for problems of interest. Solutions are generally organized by their structure or approach. However, this is mostly a personal repository intended to keep a history of all the working solutions to challenges that I have implemented.
